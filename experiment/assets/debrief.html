     <h1 style="text-align:center">Thank you for taking part in the study!</h1>

     <p> This study aimed to see if the inverse base-rate effect was present in
     this simple experiment, where errors could not be made. Using the previous
     work on the inverse base-rate effect (see Don, Worthy and Livesey (2021)
     for review), we hypothesise that when the ability to make errors in the
     learning phase is removed, participants will not exhibit the inverse
     base-rate effect.

       <strong>EXIT EXPERIMENT</strong> button at the end of this page.

       <br><br>If you wish to withdraw your data from the study, please email either the
       researchers or the project supervisor, Andy Wills.
       If you choose to do this, all of your data will be deleted and destroyed,
       If you are concerned about your psychological well-being after the study,
       please either contact the researchers, project supervisor or the university
       well-being team.
