    <p> In this online study you will be asked to complete two phases: one
    learning phase and one testing phase. In the learning phase you will be
    shown statements about people having various symptoms that are linked to a
    disease, e.g., “Jonathan has a rash and a fever which means he has disease
    Z.” All diseases are completely fictional. After 16 trials you can choose
    to move onto the testing phase or you can complete all the learning trials
    before moving onto the testing phase.
    </p>
    <p> In the testing phase you will be asked to identify which symptoms are
    linked to which diseases by pressing a specific key for each disease. The
    keys will correspond to the disease name. No feedback will be given to
    you in either phase. </p>
    <p> The purpose of this experiment is to study  basic processes of learning.
    There are no foreseeable risks or discomfort associated with completing
    this study.
